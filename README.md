# CopyATweet
The script is very simple, made in one day with an API. It's just the begining of the project 

* The script copies someone's last tweet and tweets it.
* You can run this script with "php index.php" command, that you can run automatically with cron (linux) or Windows tasks every minute for exemple.
* You just have to download the project, configure the index.php and that's all.
