# CopyATweet
 Script that copies someone's last tweet and tweets it
 You can run this script with "php index.php" command, that you can run automatically with cron (linux) or Windows tasks every minute for exemple
 
 The script is very simple, made in one day with an API. It's just the begining of the project
